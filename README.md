### ***Description***

#### One of the things I find myself having problems with when I'm trying to pick out what to cook for dinner is navigating the endless amounts of recipes on personal blogs, cooking sites, and even Tik Toks. That's why I developed Recipedia. Recipedia allows you to navigate through recipes, add new recipes, or update existing recipes if you've tried it and have ideas for improvement.

### ***Technologies Used***

* JavaScript
* React
* Insomnia
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Express

***

### ***Getting Started***

##### To start, you can navigate through the existing recipes on Recipedia. You are able to search recipes or scroll through them based on recipe type, total preparation and cooking time, or an alphabetized list.
##### To create a new recipe, you can click to the form that allows for recipe creation. 
##### A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/I3xYgzyv/recipedia).
##### The project itself was deployed and can be viewed [here](URL).
