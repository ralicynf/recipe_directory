### ***Description***

#### One of the things I find myself having problems with when I'm trying to pick out what to cook for dinner is navigating the endless amounts of recipes on personal blogs, cooking sites, and even Tik Toks. That's why I developed Recipedia. Recipedia allows you to navigate through recipes, add new recipes, or update existing recipes if you've tried it and have ideas for improvement.

### ***Technologies Used***

* JavaScript
* React
* Insomnia
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Express

***

### ***Getting Started***

##### To start, you can navigate through the existing recipes on Recipedia. Recipes are listed in the homepage and show an image and the food. You can click on each recipe in order to view the details of the recipe.
##### To create a new recipe, you can click to the form that allows for recipe creation. Recipes can be edited or deleted from the recipe details page.
##### A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/I3xYgzyv/recipedia).
##### The project itself was deployed and can be viewed [here](URL).
